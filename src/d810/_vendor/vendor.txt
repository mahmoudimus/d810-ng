# d810 Vendored Dependencies
#
# This file lists all vendored dependencies. Format follows pip's vendor.txt.
# Dependencies are vendored as source directories to avoid conflicts with
# IDA Pro's Python environment.
#
# To update vendored packages:
# 1. Update version here
# 2. Download/clone the new version
# 3. Copy source into src/d810/_vendor/<package>/
# 4. Apply any necessary patches from tools/vendoring/patches/
# 5. Test thoroughly
#
# Currently vendored:
# (none yet - placeholder for future vendoring)
#
# Candidates for vendoring:
# - miasm2: If we need specific version/patches for IDA compatibility
# - z3-solver: If bundling is needed for binary distributions
# - Any other dependencies that cause conflicts in IDA environment

# Example format (when vendoring):
# miasm==0.1.5+d810.1
#     # Custom d810 build with IDA compatibility patches
