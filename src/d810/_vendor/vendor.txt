# d810 Vendored Dependencies
#
# This file lists all vendored dependencies. Format follows pip's vendor.txt.
# Dependencies are vendored as source directories to avoid conflicts with
# IDA Pro's Python environment.
#
# To update vendored packages:
# 1. Update version here
# 2. Download/clone the new version
# 3. Copy source into src/d810/_vendor/<package>/
# 4. Apply any necessary patches from tools/vendoring/patches/
# 5. Test thoroughly
#
# Currently vendored:

# ida-reloader - Hot-reload infrastructure for IDA Pro plugins
# Source: https://github.com/mahmoudimus/ida-reloader
# Vendored from: src/d810/ida_reloadable.py (previously standalone file)
# Version: 0.1.0 (extracted from d810)
# Reason: Core infrastructure for plugin reloading, tightly integrated with d810
ida-reloader==0.1.0+d810
    # Provides Reloader, DependencyGraph, _Scanner for hot-reloading
    # No patches needed - used as-is

#
# Candidates for future vendoring:
# - miasm2: If we need specific version/patches for IDA compatibility
# - z3-solver: If bundling is needed for binary distributions
# - Any other dependencies that cause conflicts in IDA environment
